# VisionDrive Documentation

This folder contains **implementation documentation** aligned with `/notes` → **Section 11 (Action Plan)**.

## How to use these docs

- Each phase (e.g. **11.1**) has its own markdown file:
  - what we built
  - which files changed
  - how to apply/run it locally
  - verification steps
  - follow-ups / known limitations

## Documents

- `11-action-plan.md`: Working copy of Section 11, used as the delivery checklist.
- `11.1-foundation.md`: Phase 11.1 (multi-tenant + data model) implementation notes.
