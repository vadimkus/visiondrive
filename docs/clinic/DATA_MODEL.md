# Practice OS — data model (quick reference)

Authoritative detail lives in **`prisma/schema.prisma`** and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md). This page is a **short map** for builders.

## Core entities

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tenants` | Practice / organization boundary. |
| `users` + `tenant_memberships` | Staff accounts; clinic login uses `users.defaultTenantId` in JWT. |
| `clinic_patients` | Demographics, contacts, home address / area / access notes, client `category` and `tags`, **internal_notes** (staff only), optional **`anamnesis_json`** (v1 JSON: allergies, medications, conditions, social). |
| `clinic_procedures` | Service catalog (duration, hidden buffer, price, currency). |
| `clinic_appointments` | Scheduled slots; richer status; source; optional procedure; hidden buffer; home-visit location and travel buffers; lifecycle timestamps; **internal_notes**; optional override reason for intentional conflict/out-of-hours bookings. |
| `clinic_appointment_events` | Appointment audit/change history for reschedules, reminders, visit actions, payments, and follow-ups. |
| `clinic_availability_rules` | Tenant working-hours rules by weekday: start/end, `slot_mode` (`FIXED`/`DYNAMIC`), slot interval, minimum lead time, active/closed day, optional `procedure_id` for service-specific overrides. |
| `clinic_blocked_times` | Manual private time / lunch / leave blocks that remove availability slots. |
| `clinic_reminder_templates` | Tenant WhatsApp/email/SMS templates for appointment reminders, no-show follow-up, rebooking follow-up, and review requests. |
| `clinic_reminder_deliveries` | Reminder schedule and preparation log: status, scheduled time, body, WhatsApp URL, errors. |
| `clinic_booking_funnel_events` | Anonymous public booking funnel events: link views, service selection, slot selection, form start/submission, and booking completion. |
| `clinic_patient_portal_links` | Hashed private patient portal links with expiry, revocation, last-access metadata, and no stored plaintext token. |
| `clinic_patient_portal_requests` | Patient-submitted portal requests for reschedule, cancellation, or message; mirrored into CRM notes for staff follow-up. |
| `clinic_intake_questions` | Service-specific public booking questions configured per procedure: prompt, help text, type, required flag, active flag, and sort order. |
| `clinic_intake_responses` | Appointment-linked intake answer snapshots from public booking, preserving the original prompt/type for clinical context. |
| `clinic_patient_reviews` | Internal review/reputation workflow: request status, rating, private note, candidate public text, requested/replied/published timestamps. |
| `clinic_visits` | Completed encounters; optional `treatment_plan_id`; **next_steps** drives “what to do next” on the chart; **inventory_consumed_at** prevents repeated auto-deduct. |
| `clinic_patient_media` | Before/after/other images captured from camera or uploaded from file picker: Postgres **`BYTEA`** and/or optional **Vercel Blob** (`blob_pathname`); mime + caption. |
| `clinic_patient_payments` | Payments; optional `visit_id` / `appointment_id`, discount, fee, method, status, reference, note. Client balance is derived from completed/arrived appointment prices, linked payments, refunds, pending rows, and standalone deposits. |
| `clinic_product_sales` + `clinic_product_sale_lines` | Retail / aftercare product sales linked to patient, optional visit/appointment, stock item lines, sale totals, and payment reference. |
| `clinic_patient_packages` + `clinic_package_redemptions` | Prepaid patient packages/courses: total/remaining sessions, optional service restriction, expiry, payment reference, and visit-linked session usage rows. |
| `clinic_consent_templates` + `clinic_consent_records` | Consent template library plus signed patient snapshots with contraindications, signature name, aftercare acknowledgement, and optional visit/appointment links. |
| `clinic_treatment_plans` | Planned courses of care for a patient: expected sessions, cadence, target dates, procedure, goals, next steps, photo milestones, status, and linked visits. |
| `clinic_crm_activities` | CRM timeline (type + body + occurred_at). |
| `clinic_stock_items` | Inventory SKU: name, unit, `quantity_on_hand`, `reorder_point`, optional legacy `procedure_id`, optional `barcode`, `consume_per_visit`, low-stock cooldown. |
| `clinic_procedure_materials` | Bill of materials rows: procedure + stock item + quantity per visit + unit material cost + active flag. |
| `clinic_stock_movements` | Receipt / adjustment / consumption / return; signed `quantity_delta`; never allows negative on-hand. |
| `clinic_stock_count_sessions` + `clinic_stock_count_lines` | Physical stock counts with expected vs counted quantities, variance reason/note, status, finalization timestamp, and adjustment movement references. |
| `clinic_purchase_orders` + `clinic_purchase_order_lines` | Supplier ordering and receiving; receipts create `RECEIPT` stock movements. |
| `clinic_web_push_subscriptions` | Browser push subscriptions for low-stock alerts. |
