### 9.3 Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "It's 15 AED/day. One prevented fine pays for 2+ years. What's your current compliance cost?" |
| "We do manual logging" | "That costs 500-1,500 AED/month in labor. Plus human error. Plus no alerts at night." |
| "We'll think about it" | "DM conducted 34,700 inspections last 6 months. When is your next one scheduled?" |
